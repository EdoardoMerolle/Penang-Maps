Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) for Tourism in Malaysia
Overview
This project is a web-based Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) designed to assist tourists in Malaysia by providing real-time, comprehensive information about accommodations, services, attractions, and flood-safe shelters. Developed for the National Water Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM), the system aims to enhance tourism experiences and improve safety in flood-prone regions by integrating an interactive map with dynamic data points, including hotels, restaurants, rental services, and more.

The SDSS allows users to:

View and interact with a map of Malaysia, displaying key tourism locations such as hotels, homestays, food and beverage outlets, and taxi services.
Search for and filter locations based on name and type (e.g., hotels, homestays).
Get real-time weather forecasts and access detailed location information, including street addresses, and images.
Find nearby services such as restaurants, rental services, and emergency shelters.
Utilize a rainfall information map for flood-related data.
Toggle between light and dark modes for enhanced usability across devices.
